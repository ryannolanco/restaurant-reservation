1. first_name and last_name
Not Empty: Ensure that these fields are not empty.
Type Check: Ensure that these fields are strings.
Length: Optionally, you may want to enforce a maximum length (e.g., 50 characters).
2. mobile_number
Not Empty: Ensure this field is not empty.
Type Check: Ensure that the input is a string.
Format Validation: Validate that the mobile number follows a specific format, e.g., a regex for a valid phone number format.
Length: Ensure that the mobile number doesn't exceed 15 characters.
3. reservation_date
Not Empty: Ensure this field is not empty.
Type Check: Ensure that the date is valid (e.g., using a date parsing library like moment or native JavaScript Date object).
Date in the Future: Ensure that the reservation date is not in the past.
Valid Date Format: Ensure the date is in the correct format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
4. reservation_time
Not Empty: Ensure this field is not empty.
Type Check: Ensure that the time is valid (e.g., using a time parsing library or regular expression).
Business Hours Check: Optionally, ensure that the time falls within the business's operating hours.
5. party_size
Not Empty: Ensure this field is not empty.
Type Check: Ensure that the input is an integer.
Minimum and Maximum Values: Ensure the party size is within a reasonable range (e.g., between 1 and 20).
6. Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
These fields are typically auto-generated by the database, so you usually don't need to validate them manually in the controller unless you're doing custom timestamp handling.
7. Additional Validations
Unique Reservations: Depending on the application's needs, you might want to ensure that a reservation is unique based on a combination of fields (e.g., mobile_number, reservation_date, and reservation_time).
Cross-Field Validations: Ensure that the reservation_time and reservation_date together form a valid reservation time (e.g., not during closed hours or outside allowed reservation times).
